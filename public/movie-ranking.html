<h2>Three movies I like</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Beetlejuice</h3>
<p>My all-time favorite; looking forward to the sequal later in the year!</p>

<h3>Fred Claus</h3>
<p>
  Underrated Christmas movie...very few people talk about it, but I think it's
  one of the better ones.

<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>
<p>This helped me about eight years ago get through a tough time!</p>
